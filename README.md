Lexicon Exercise 1

This was a timed exercise where we were tasked with creating a local registry that allows adding and displaying employees. While we were encouraged to future-proof the solution as much as possible, that was not a core requirement of the assignment.

The time limit was two hours (if I remember correctly), so there are a few noticeable issues in the implementation, such as repetitive code and some problems with the separation of concerns in the Employee class. These are areas I would refactor given more time.
